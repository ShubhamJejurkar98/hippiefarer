            `Stone Chariot at Vittala Temple is actually a shrine dedicated to Garuda, built inside the Vittala Temple Complex.
             The massive sculpture of Garuda, Lord Vishnuâ€™s escort, once was seated atop the chariot but it is empty at the present date. 
             The Hampi Chariot has earned its name among the other three famous stone chariots in India- One in Konark, Odissa, and the 
             other in Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu). Inspired by the Dravidian style of architecture, the chariot is a colossal structure which
             shows the skill of the earlier craftsmen and architects. The beauty of the chariot lies in the fact that it looks like one 
             solid structure but in fact, has been built by slabs of granite whose linkages have been cleverly hidden with artistic designs.
